### Hi there 👋

- 👨‍💻 Software Engineer at Big Tech (you'll never know which one)
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Infra in C++ & Mentoring candidates thru interviews
- 🌱 I’m currently learning System Design for Distributed Systems & Microservices
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects for Social Good (at least that's what I'm supposed to say)
- 💬 Ask me about Algorithms & Data Structures, I am ranked top ~20% on LeetCode Contests
- ⚡ Fun fact: I play Chess (occasionally) instead of updating my GithHub (ever)
